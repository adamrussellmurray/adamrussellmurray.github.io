                  rather the first column would be on top of the second column (meaning that they would be displayed
                  vertically (no effect of display:inline-block)), since two columns would actually not fit in
                  horizontally to add up to 100% width.
                 There are two reasons for this. 1) there is a small space between two columns, which can be removed
                 by setting font-size to 0, to but that gets into CSS trickery so I am not doing this. 2) the padding
                 itself changes the width of the element. With two padding properties as above, the actual width is then
                 45% + 15px + 15px. If each column was exactly 50%, then with padding they would be  50% + 15px + 15px
                 in width, so it would be impossible to fit in two columns.

				<p>
				I'm an assistant professor in the <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/philosophy/" target="_blank">Department of Philosophy</a> at the <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/" target="_blank">University of Manitoba</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Before coming to Manitoba, I was a lecturer in the <a href="http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Department of Philosophy</a> at the University of Toronto, where I also did my PhD.
				</p>
				<p>
				I work primarily on topics at the intersection
of logic and metaphysics. I wrote my  dissertation on the theoretical significance of context-relativity for modal metaphysics, under the supervision of <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/jmwilson/" target="_blank">Jessica Wilson</a> and <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/benj/" target="_blank">Benj Hellie</a>, with <a href="http://www.natecharlow.com/" target="_blank">Nate Charlow</a> and <a href="https://philosophy.utoronto.ca/directory/nick-stang/" target="_blank">Nick Stang</a> as readers and <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~lderosse/" target="_blank">Louis deRosset</a> as my external examiner.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the current academic year, I am the chair of the <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/departments/philosophy/grad_program/graduateprogram.html" target="_blank">graduate program in philosophy</a> at Manitoba.
