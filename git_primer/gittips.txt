Inside of the adamrussellmurray.github.io local repository execute
|git status| to see what files have changed, and the |git add .|  to stage
(prepare for the commit) all of the changed files.

After staging the files, execute |git commit -m "the message of the commit"| to
create a commit with changed files. If git asks you to enter information about
the author of the commit, then you can follow the commands in the cheat sheet to
do so, but in short it is: git config user.name “Some Username” git config
user.email “some@email.com”

Finally: |git push| to sync the changes in your local repository with
the remote repository. 

 Your remote website is available at
"https://adamrussellmurray.github.io/", while your local website is available at
"file://<path_to_index>" (ie:
"file:///usr/adam/Desktop/adamrussellmurray.github.io/index.html")
